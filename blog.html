<p>I have used html before this, but only a very small amount, so I had to do some research to figure out the correct tags to use. I found good answers on Youtube, as I have for most other types of programming.</p>
<p>The harder part of the assignment for me was getting my files to the engineering webspace. I am pretty sure I have figured it out now. I originally followed the engineering account webspace link, which didnt have instructions.</p>
<p>I'm hoping that the instructions I found on the ONID link work. If this gets posted, then I will know they did.
