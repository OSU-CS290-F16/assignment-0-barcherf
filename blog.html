<p>I have used HTML before this, but only a very small amount, so I had to do some research to figure out the correct tags to use. I found good answers on YouTube, as I have for most other types of programming.
The harder part of the assignment for me was getting my files to the engineering webspace. I am pretty sure I have figured it out now. I originally followed the engineering account webspace link, which didn't have instructions.
I'm hoping that the instructions I found on the ONID link work. If this gets posted, then I will know they did.</p>
<p>Update: It worked. The trouble was that I had posted my files to my ONID account and was using the ENGR link instead of the ONID one.</p>
